# Testing on an Emulator
You could also test the app on an emulator:<br>
> Install Android SDK Tools Revision 24.3, if you have not done so.<br>
> Enroll a new fingerprint in the emulator by going to Settings ⇒ Security ⇒ Fingerprint, then follow the enrollment instructions.<br>
> Use an emulator to emulate fingerprint touch events with the following command. Use the same command to emulate fingerprint touch events on the lockscreen or in your app.<br>
adb -e emu finger touch <finger_id>
